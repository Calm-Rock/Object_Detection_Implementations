Ever thought of building a surveillance setup ? Now all you need is a simple android smart phone and the above python notebook :D <br>
Just download the IP Connect app from the play store. Connect your phone and laptop on a common hotspot or network (No internet needed). Just start the server in the app
and feed in the IP address in the notebook. After this, just run the code and BAM!!! you'll get the feed in the laptop.<br>
You can also see the video by typing the IP address in your web browser(This gives you more functionality like recording, image capture etc.)<br>
You can also live stream the video feed in VLC media player wither on another phone or Laptop (Ain't that Cool!? ). For mobile phone, just select
the Open MRL option in VLC app and feed in the IP along with <code> /video </code> at the end and you should be good to go :).<br>

#### Why the hell do I want to do this ?
Well, I wanted to implement this for detecting objects ('cause I was a bit frustrated by Object Detection). And guess what, I actually did it(This Repo is made for this).<br>

A lot of credits goes to the creator of ImageAI library, it really makes the object detection task easy.
