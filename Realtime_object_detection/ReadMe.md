Yay!! This is the thing I wanted to implement from a long time.<br>
With this code, you can detect objects in realtime just with the help of your smart phone using the android app named IP Camera.<br>
To see the results, just download the camera_detected_1.avi file (slowmotion preferred) or better yet, just run this file in the <code>video_slicer </code> repository code and watch it frame by frame to get a better gist of all the objects detected :)
